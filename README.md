Cardano Catalyst F11 proposal: Open-Source Audited Framework to Raise Funds for Documentary Production

Welcome to the GitHub repo for our tokenomics framework for capital raising, production and distribution of narrative documentaries using Cardano blockchain.

We currently have a funding proposal in Cardano Catalyst, fund 11. Following are details on our proposal.

Purpose of the F11 proposal: 
There are no open-source audited frameworks for raising capital to produce screen based entertainment intended for distribution on a blockchain. So, this proposal seeks to conduct research, and engage legal and accounting experts to refine a framework for capital rasing, production, and distributnio fo screen based entertainment using blockchain.

We will create an audited capital raising and distribution framework, specifically designed for blockchain. We will create a framework for documentary production, and have it independently reviewed.

This project does not have any dependencies on other organizations, technical or otherwise.

This project outcome will be completely open-source.

Potential use case:
A media production company uses the framework to plan their own fundingraising, production, and distribution of sceen media content using cardano blockchain. 
A developer plans the smart contracts needed to distribute screen content using the framework as a guide.

The framework will aim to meet the needs of screen content consumers and producers, including jurisdiction requirements. Australia and Europe will be contrasted as jurisdictions for this proposal.

Creating an open-source audited framework designed to raise capital to produce screen-based entertainment with the intent of distribution on a blockchain could greatly benefit Cardano. The framework would serve as a model for facilitating the creation of content by providing a structured and independently reviewed approach. This would contribute to fostering a more robust and independent media production environment for Cardano.
