# documentary-token-framework

### Did you know?
Most screen content does not make sufficent returns to repay the cost of production.

## Welcome
Thanks for taking the time to vist our repo. This is the very biginning of a long arc of research that will aim to investigating using blockchain to produce screen content. The main idea of the project, is to allow content creators to have bigger buderts, to produce better stuff! If this project is successful, then old-tales will may make something, and other content creators will also be able to use the framework to make their own stuff.

## Cardano Catalyst F11 proposal
### Open-Source Audited Framework to Raise Funds for Documentary Production
A tokenomics framework for capital raising, production and distribution for narrative documentaries using Cardano blockchain.
### Purpose of the F11 proposal
There are no open-source audited frameworks for raising capital to produce screen based entertainment intended for distribution on a blockchain. So, this proposal seeks to conduct research, and engage legal and accounting experts to refine a framework for capital rasing, production, and distribution fo screen based entertainment using blockchain. We will create an audited capital raising and distribution framework, specifically designed for blockchain. We will create a framework for documentary production, and have it independently reviewed.
### Open source
This project outcome will be completely open-source.
### Potential use case
A media production could company uses the framework to plan their own fundraising, production, and distribution of screen media content using Cardano blockchain. 
### Juristictions
The framework will aim to meet the needs of screen content consumers and producers, including jurisdiction requirements. Australia and Europe will be contrasted as jurisdictions for this proposal.
### Benefits
Creating an open-source audited framework designed to raise capital to produce screen-based entertainment with the intent of distribution on a blockchain could greatly benefit Cardano. The framework would serve as a model for facilitating the creation of content produced with a reasonable budget, by providing a structured and independently reviewed approach. This would contribute to fostering a more robust and independent media production environment for Cardano.
