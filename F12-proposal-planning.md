# F12 Catalyst proposal planning
### Introduction
This proposal outlines a strategy for raising funds for media production within Australian and EU tax frameworks, leveraging blockchain technology and focusing on 
compliance. It involves 
researching token-based fundraising and consulting with legal and accounting experts to ensure adherence to tax laws. Our goal is to offer an alternative to platforms like YouTube by using 
blockchain for a more open media environment. Funded by Catalyst, this initiative aims to support our and others' content creation, exploring new revenue models beyond traditional sources like 
YouTube ads.

The proposal focuses on using blockchain, particularly tokens, for fundraising, content management, and distribution, with Cardano as our chosen platform. This approach seeks to navigate tax 
regulations in Australia and the EU, ensuring compliance through legal and accounting reviews. We aim to address the limitations of centralized media platforms by promoting transparency and open 
access, enabling unrestricted media production and distribution.

By adopting blockchain technology for fundraising and media distribution, we aim to create a decentralized alternative to centralized platforms. Cardano will support our transparent, open-access 
approach, bypassing restrictions from traditional media outlets. This initiative extends beyond our own media production, aiming to support diverse projects and explore alternative revenue models, 
fostering a collaborative ecosystem for media creators. Funded by Catalyst, we plan to open-source our findings to promote innovation in media production.
